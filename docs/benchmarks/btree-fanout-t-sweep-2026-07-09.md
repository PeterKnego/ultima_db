# B-tree fanout (`T`) sweep — bench-host results (2026-07-09)

Authoritative AWS-NVMe results behind the `T = 32 → 64` default bump (task50 §fanout,
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-08-btree-optimization-candidates.md` §2). Preserved here because
`bench-infra/bench-out/` is gitignored — the summary tables live in the task docs, but the raw
per-run data (below) would otherwise be lost.

**Host (all runs):** AWS local-NVMe, 8 vcpu, 15701 MB, kernel `6.17.0-1019-aws`. Provisioned +
torn down per run via `bench-infra` (`make bench-oneshot`-style, guaranteed teardown).

## ⭐ The core finding: fanout `T` pulls reads and writes in *opposite* directions

**This is the single most important result from all the fanout testing. Bigger `T` makes reads
faster and CoW writes slower — on the *same tree* — because reads only *traverse* nodes while writes
*clone* them.** Any future re-tuning of `T` (or a decision to make it configurable) must weigh both
sides; you cannot optimize `T` for one without paying on the other.

| | What `T` controls | Effect of **bigger** `T` | Net |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Read** (`get`, p99-under-load) | tree **height** ≈ `ln N / ln T` — nodes *traversed & binary-searched*, never copied | shallower tree → fewer cache-missing hops | **faster** ✅ (T=64 read p99 **−62%**) |
| **CoW write** (SMR-apply update on a warm/shared tree) | **width** of each node cloned by `Arc::make_mut` on the root→leaf path, O(`T`) per node | total copy ≈ height × width ≈ `T / ln T` — *increasing* in `T` for T>e | **slower** ❌ (T=64 apply **−22%**) |

**Why writes lose despite the shallower tree:** a CoW write must `Arc::make_mut`-clone every node on
its path that is still shared with a retained snapshot, and each clone deep-copies that node's full
`entries`/`children` `Vec` (width O(`T`)). Fewer levels (`1/ln T`) but each level twice as wide
(`∝ T`) nets out to `T / ln T` copy work — e.g. `32/ln32 ≈ 9.2` → `64/ln64 ≈ 15.4`, ~**1.7× more
copy per update** at T=64. Reads pay none of this: they clone nothing, so they only see the height
win. (Details + code anchors in §3.)

> **Corollary — the write penalty is an MVCC-sharing tax, not intrinsic to `T`.** It exists *only*
> because `make_mut` finds nodes shared with live snapshots (warm store, ~10 retained). On a cold
> store with uniquely-owned nodes, `make_mut` mutates in place, the O(`T`) clones vanish, and bigger
> `T` would help writes too (shallower descent). The read/write split is a property of copy-on-write
> under retained readers, not of B-trees in general.

## TL;DR

- **Uncontended bulk ops (1M random keys):** larger `T` wins monotonically up to ~64. **T=64**
  is the balance point — get −18–28%, insert ~−8%, remove ~−6–19% vs T=32; T=128 helps writes a
  hair more but regresses reads.
- **Contended SMR-apply + read-under-load:** "apply" here is the **SMR apply path**
  (`Persistence::smr` — replaying *already-committed* batches from the consensus log into the CoW
  tree, not an interactive `WriteTx::commit`). **T=64 costs −22% apply throughput** (bigger nodes →
  bigger `Arc::make_mut` memmove/CoW per applied batch) but gives **−62% read p99** (shallower tree
  → consistent low tail). Both effects are tight and reproducible (15 runs/arm, non-overlapping).
- **T=48 is dominated:** ~full apply hit (−19%), *bimodal* p99 (median no better than T=32), only
  ~half the bulk get win. No useful middle ground — the metrics are non-monotonic in `T`.
- **Decision: keep `T=64`.** −22% SMR-apply accepted for the broad read/bulk/p99 wins.

## 1. Bulk fanout — full sweep `T ∈ {8,16,32,64,128}`, 1M random keys

Post in-place rebalancing (task50 §5.1). Times normalized to T=32, **lower = faster**.
Run `20260709T065146Z`, git `906e5a4`, rustc 1.96.1.

| T | MAX_KEYS | get | insert | remove |
|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 8 | 15 | 1.73 | 1.27 | 1.24 |
| 16 | 31 | 1.26 | 1.07 | 1.00 |
| **32** | **63** | **1.00** | **1.00** | **1.00** |
| 64 | 127 | 0.82 | 0.92 | 0.81 |
| 128 | 255 | 0.96 | 0.88 | 0.80 |

Absolute @T=32: get 213.0 ms, insert 512.5 ms, remove 450.4 ms.

## 2. Bulk fanout — `T ∈ {32,48,64}` (the T=48 point)

Separate run (`20260709T092723Z`, git `05b19ea`) — its T=64 numbers differ from §1 by run-to-run
noise (get 0.72 vs 0.82), so **T=48 must be read against *this* run's T=32/64, not spliced into §1.**

| T | MAX_KEYS | get | insert | remove |
|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| **32** | **63** | **1.00** | **1.00** | **1.00** |
| 48 | 95 | 0.83 | 0.95 | 0.99 |
| 64 | 127 | 0.72 | 0.94 | 0.94 |

Absolute @T=32: get 179.0 ms, insert 411.4 ms, remove 333.3 ms. T=48 keeps ~half the get win and
essentially none of the insert/remove win.

## 3. SMR-apply + read-p99-under-load — `T ∈ {32,48,64}`, 15 runs/arm (authoritative)

Run `20260709T130609Z`, git `07cf6ba`, rustc 1.97.0. `median [min-max]`, ratio ×T32.
`apply_sw_batch_throughput` higher = better; `read_p99_under_load_ns` lower = better.

> **Where the fanout cost actually lands: the row update, not the commit.** Each timed txn is
> `begin_write → open_table → update → commit` (`smr_bench.rs` block (c)). The `T`-dependent cost is
> entirely in `tbl.update` → `BTree::insert_mut` (`table.rs:317`), which `Arc::make_mut`-copies every
> node on the root→leaf path still shared with the live snapshot — bigger `T` = bigger node `Vec` =
> bigger memmove per copied node. `commit_single_writer` (`store.rs:2638`) is a *fixed* cost
> independent of `T`: it Arc-clones the table map, wraps the already-built dirty tree, and inserts a
> snapshot — it never touches a B-tree node. And because this is SMR mode (no `wal_handle`), commit
> does **no fsync/parking**. So "apply throughput" here is the CoW path-copy rate, **not** a commit
> rate — which is exactly why fanout moves it.

| T | MAX_KEYS | apply throughput | read p99 (ns) |
|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| **32** | 63 | 346014 [343330–347444] · 1.00× | 2287 [2194–2367] · 1.00× |
| 48 | 95 | 280970 [279803–281393] · 0.81× | 2325 [993–2445] · 1.02× |
| 64 | 127 | 270670 [267266–271300] · 0.78× | 859 [715–958] · 0.38× |

**apply throughput** arms are razor-tight and non-overlapping → the −19%/−22% regression is real.
**read p99**: T=32 and T=48 overlap (T=48 is *bimodal* — see raw runs below: four ~1000 ns runs,
eleven ~2300 ns); only **T=64 is a clean, separated −62%**. The earlier "T=48 worse than both"
reading was p99 noise — the ranges show it's not.

> Note: a *sandbox* SMR-ab run showed T=64 p99 *worse* (+41%) — a VM-contention artifact. The
> bench host (dedicated NVMe) is authoritative and shows the opposite: T=64 p99 much better.
